# Project Overview:
This project involves the cleaning and preprocessing of a dataset with a focus on preparing the date_added column. The primary objective is to ensure all date values follow a consistent format and handle any inconsistencies within the data.
# Key Steps:

Data Inspection:
Initially, the dataset was reviewed to check for inconsistencies in the date_added column, such as varying date formats and extra spaces.

Removing Extra Spaces:
Extra spaces were removed from the date_added column using the TRIM function in Excel.

Formatting Dates:
The date_added column was formatted to a consistent date format (e.g., yyyy-mm-dd or dd-mm-yyyy) using Excelâ€™s Format Cells feature.

Text-to-Date Conversion:
In cases where dates were not recognized as valid date values, the Text to Columns feature was used to convert the data into proper date format.

# Outcome:
All values in the date_added column are now in a consistent format, making it easier for further analysis and ensuring data integrity.
